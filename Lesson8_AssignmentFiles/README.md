### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned how to change the code in order to make the Seminole Movie Connector work. 
2. I learned how to use the list-group-item function to add multiple categories about each movie for example the year, title, and writer of the movie. 
3. I also listed each of these categories to a json function that allowed them to be able to pull the info from the OMDb website.
